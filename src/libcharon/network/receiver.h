/**
 * Receives packets from the socket and adds them to the job queue.
 *
 * The receiver starts a thread, wich reads on the blocking socket. A received
 * packet is preparsed and a process_message_job is queued in the job queue.
 *
 * To endure DoS attacks, cookies are enabled when to many IKE_SAs are half
 * open. The calculation of cookies is slightly different from the proposed
 * method in RFC4306. We do not include a nonce, because we think the advantage
 * we gain does not justify the overhead to parse the whole message.
 * Instead of VersionIdOfSecret, we include a timestamp. This allows us to
 * find out wich key was used for cookie creation. Further, we can set a
 * lifetime for the cookie, which allows us to reuse the secret for a longer
 * time.
 *		 COOKIE = time | sha1( IPi | SPIi | time | secret )
 *
 * The secret is changed after a certain amount of cookies sent. The old
 * secret is stored to allow a clean migration between secret changes.
 *
 * Further, the number of half-initiated IKE_SAs is limited per peer. This
 * mades it impossible for a peer to flood the server with its real IP address.
