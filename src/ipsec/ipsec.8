.SH NAME
ipsec \- invoke IPsec utilities
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ipsec
\fIcommand\fP [ \fIarguments\fP ] [ \fIoptions\fP ]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ipsec
utility invokes any of several utilities involved in controlling and monitoring
the IPsec encryption/authentication system, running the specified \fIcommand\fP
with the specified \fIarguments\fP and \fIoptions\fP as if it had been invoked
directly. This largely eliminates possible name collisions with other software,
and also permits some centralized services.
.PP
All the commands described in this manual page are built-in and are used to
control and monitor IPsec connections as well as the IKE daemons.
.PP
For other commands
.I ipsec
supplies the invoked
.I command
with a suitable PATH environment variable,
and also provides IPSEC_DIR,
IPSEC_CONFS, and IPSEC_VERSION environment variables,
containing respectively
the full pathname of the directory where the IPsec utilities are stored,
the full pathname of the directory where the configuration files live,
and the IPsec version number.
.PP
.SS CONTROL COMMANDS
.TP
.B "ipsec start [ starter options ]"
calls
.BR "ipsec starter"
which in turn parses \fIipsec.conf\fR and starts the IKEv1 \fIpluto\fR and
IKEv2 \fIcharon\fR daemons.
.PP
.TP
.B "ipsec update"
sends a \fIHUP\fR signal to
.BR "ipsec starter"
which in turn determines any changes in \fIipsec.conf\fR
and updates the configuration on the running IKEv1 \fIpluto\fR and IKEv2
\fIcharon\fR daemons, correspondingly.
.PP
.TP
.B "ipsec reload"
sends a \fIUSR1\fR signal to
.BR "ipsec starter"
which in turn reloads the whole configuration on the running IKEv1 \fIpluto\fR
and IKEv2 \fIcharon\fR daemons based on the actual \fIipsec.conf\fR.
.PP
.TP
.B "ipsec restart"
is equivalent to
.B "ipsec stop"
followed by
.B "ipsec start"
after a guard of 2 seconds.
.PP
.TP
.B "ipsec stop"
terminates all IPsec connections and stops the IKEv1 \fIpluto\fR and IKEv2
\fIcharon\fR daemons by sending a \fITERM\fR signal to
.BR "ipsec starter".
.PP
.TP
.B "ipsec up \fIname\fP"
tells the responsible IKE daemon to start up connection \fIname\fP.
.PP
.TP
.B "ipsec down \fIname\fP"
tells the responsible IKE daemon to terminate connection \fIname\fP.
.PP
.TP
.B "ipsec down \fIname{n}\fP"
terminates IKEv2 CHILD SA instance \fIn\fP of connection \fIname\fP.

.PP
.TP
.B "ipsec route \fIname\fP"

for connection \fIname\fP. The first payload packet matching the IPsec policy
will automatically trigger an IKE connection setup.
.PP
.TP
.B "ipsec unroute \fIname\fP"
remove the IPsec policy in the kernel for connection \fIname\fP.
