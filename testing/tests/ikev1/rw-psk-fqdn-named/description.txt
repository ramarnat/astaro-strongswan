The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>. The authentication is
based on <b>Preshared Keys</b> (PSK) and <b>Fully Qualified Domain Names</b> (ID_FQDN). 
<b>leftfirewall=yes</b> automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the
tunneled traffic. In order to test the tunnel <b>carol</b> pings the client <b>alice</b> behind
the gateway <b>moon</b>.
<p>
The significant difference between this scenario and the test
<a href="../rw-psk-fqdn"><b>rw-psk-fqdn</b></a>
is the additional line <b>rightid=@carol.strongswan.org</b> by which gateway
<b>moon</b> restricts the roadwarrior connection to host <b>carol</b>.
