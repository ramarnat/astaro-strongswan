Roadwarrior <b>carol</b> and gateway <b>moon</b> each generate a
PKCS#1 RSA private key and a self-signed X.509 certificate
using the <b>ipsec scepclient</b> function. Because the UML testing
environment does not offer enough entropy, the non-blocking /dev/urandom
device is used in place of /dev/random for generating the random primes.
<p>
The self-signed certificates are then distributed to the peers via scp
and are used to set up a road warrior connection initiated by <b>carol</b>
