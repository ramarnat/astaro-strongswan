This test is based on the <a href="../mode-config">mode-config</a>
scenario and demonstrates the multiple use of the <b>include</b>
parameter in IPsec configuration files. At the top level <b>/etc/ipsec.conf</b>
defines the config setup section and includes <b>/etc/ipsec.connections</b>
which in turn includes <b>/etc/ipsec.host</b> and <b>/etc/ipsec.peers/*</b>
thereby showing the use of wildcards in path definitions.
