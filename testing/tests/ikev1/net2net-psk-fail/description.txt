An IPsec tunnel connecting the subnets behind the gateways <b>moon</b> and 
<b>sun</b> is set up. The authentication is based on <b>Preshared Keys</b>
(PSK). Unfortunately the secret keys of <b>moon</b> and <b>sun</b> do not
match, so that the responder cannot decrypt ISAKMP message MI3. The resulting
encrypted notification message cannot in turn be read by the initiator
<b>moon</b>. In order to avoid a <b>notify-war</b>, any further generation of
PAYLOAD_MALFORMED messages is suppressed.
