By setting <b>strictcrlpolicy=yes</b> a <b>strict CRL policy</b> is enforced on
both roadwarrior <b>carol</b> and gateway <b>moon</b>. Thus when <b>carol</b> initiates
the connection and only an expired CRL cache file in <b>/etc/ipsec.d/crls</b> is
available, the Main Mode negotiation fails. A http fetch for an updated CRL fails
because the web server is currently not reachable. Thus the second Main Mode negotiation
fails, too. Finally an ldap fetch to get the CRL from the LDAP server <b>winnetou</b>
is triggered. When the third Main Mode trial comes around, the fetched CRL has become
available and the IKE negotiation completes. The new CRL is again cached locally as a
file in <b>/etc/ipsec.d/crls</b> due to the <b>cachecrls=yes</b> option.
