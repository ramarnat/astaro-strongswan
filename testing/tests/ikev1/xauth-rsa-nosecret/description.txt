The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The authentication is based on RSA signatures (<b>RSASIG</b>) using X.509
certificates followed by extended authentication (<b>XAUTH</b>) based
on user name and password. Because user <b>carol</b> cannot find her 
XAUTH credentials in ipsec.secrets, the IKE negotation is aborted and the
ISAKMP SA is deleted.
