All IP traffic from the subnet behind the gateway <b>moon</b> is tunneled
to the gateway  <b>sun</b> using the 0.0.0.0/0 network mask. In order
to prevent local subnet traffic from escaping through the tunnel, a
passthrough policy for the 10.1.0.0/16 network is inserted on <b>moon</b>.
A series of internal and external pings verifies the correct
functioning of the setup.
