The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The authentication is based on <b>X.509 certificates</b>. Upon the successful
establishment of the IPsec tunnel, <b>leftfirewall=yes</b> automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, <b>carol</b> pings the client
<b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
