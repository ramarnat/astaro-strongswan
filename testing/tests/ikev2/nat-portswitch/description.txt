The roadwarrior <b>alice</b> sitting behind the NAT router <b>moon</b> sets up a connection 
to gateway <b>sun</b> using IKEv2. UDP encapsulation is used to traverse the NAT router.
The authentication is based on locally loaded <b>X.509 certificates</b>.
After the IPsec Setup NAT router moon "crashes" (i.e. flushes its conntrack
table) and with the next dpd sent from <b>alice</b> a dynamical address update
should occur in gateway <b>sun</b>.
