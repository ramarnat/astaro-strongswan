The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The authentication is based on <b>X.509 certificates</b>. Upon the successful
establishment of the IPsec tunnel, <b>leftfirewall=yes</b> automatically inserts
ip6tables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both the IPv6 ESP tunnel and the firewall rules, <b>carol</b>
sends an IPv6 ICMP request to the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>
using the ping6 command.
