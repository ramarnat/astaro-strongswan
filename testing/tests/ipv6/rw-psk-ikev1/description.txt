The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up an IPv6 tunnel connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The authentication is based on <b>Preshared Keys</b> (PSK) and <b>IPv6 addresses</b> (ID_IPV6_ADDR).
<b>firewall=yes</b> automatically inserts ip6tables-based firewall rules that let pass
the tunneled traffic. In order to test the tunnel <b>carol</b> sends an IPv6
ICMP request to client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b> using the ping6 command.
